# <b> Note Taker </b> 

## <b><u> Project Description:  </b></u>
In this project, I was given the starter code which consisted of the html layout, css, and some javascript. We had to make it so the site saved the notes and the proper routes were in place.
## <b><u> How to use:  </b></u>
When you first visit the website, you will be greeted with a landing page. If you hit the <u>"Get Started"</u> button it will bring you to a section where you can create notes. If you click on the <u>"Note Title"</u> you can type the title of your note. If you click on <u>"Note Text"</u> then you can type the description or details of your note. <br />
To save the note, you must have a title and description. Once you have both a save icon will appear in the top right, next to the plus icon. This will then save your note on the left hand side. You will be able to go and view your notes anytime. <br />
If you want to create a new note, then click on the plus icon in the top right corner.
